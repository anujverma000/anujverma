Finally there is an standard way to meta-program for javascript objects.  
Proxy object is more generalized way of overriding or extending the behavior of some fundamental operations on object.  

For starter consider a problem if the given property available in object invoke a given callback function.  
_Simple solution: keep running an infinite loop and keep checking._

I know you hate this solution. And there is a better way to achieve this with proxy.  
Let me give a quick solution to this problem.  

### Define a proxy object
```javascript
  let user = {};
  user = new Proxy(user, {});
```

From the code above, its very easy to define the proxy functions. 
It take two parameters,
 - First is the target object whose we want to extend the behavior.
 - Second is `handler` object.
    - handler object defines the `traps`. Yes these are called traps.

 ```javascript
    let handler = {
      set: function(val){
         // call the callback function.
      }
    }
 ```

 Let's see how it can be a reusable function

 ```javascript
    const whenAvailable = (target, property, callback) => 
      new Proxy(target, {
        set: (object, property, value) => { 
          // store the value in property of object.
          object[property] = value;

          //call the callback
          callback(value);

          //return success
          return true;
        } 
    });

    // Lets define a new object user object. If the user is set to loggedIn, do some stuff.
    let user = {};
    user = whenAvailable(user, 'isLoggedIn', (isLoggedInStatus) => {
      if(isLoggedInStatus){
        // do some stuff.
      }
    })

    // some where else, if user is set to LoggedIn
    user.isLoggedIn = true;
 ```
Now you can understand how powerful Proxy is. We have seen the use of `set` trap. There are many more of these traps. 

  - handler.get 
  - handler.set
  - handler.has
  - handler.apply
  - handler.construct
  - handler.ownKeys
  - handler.deleteProperty
  - handler.defineProperty
  - handler.isExtensible
  - handler.preventExtensions
  - handler.getPrototypeOf
  - handler.setPrototypeOf
  - handler.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
