React Native helps us to write code once and run on android and iOs at the same time.

It has its on issues, that let developers to think against of it. 
Let me tell you, these issues are getting fixed by core team of react native and its awesome community, each passing day.


Fixing these performance issues has two parts in it.

## Finding what is slow and Fixing what is slow
 - Measure you app
 - Find something that takes time to Load
 - Find something that can be loaded later.
 - Find what all can be loaded in parallel.

If your app is slow, you need to find out what `slow` means.

## Slow
Let understand what slow means:

 - Load time is slow.
 - Animation is slow.
 - Data Fetch is slow.
 - Scroll through long list is slow.

Now we know what slow is lets, what we can do about it.
 
### Options we have :
 - Since imports are eager loading, we can delay loading components which are not needed on startup. Should start using old common js inline `require`.
 - RAM Bundling, best works on iOS
 - Use keys for list
 - Create Trace Component
    ```js
      <Trace type='start' name='MyComponent'/>
        <MyComponent />
      <Trace type='stop' name='MyComponent'/>
      
      class Trace = ({type, name}) => {
        // Get the performance metrics and send to server
        metrics[name][type] = performanceNow();
      }
    ``` 
 - Use `react-devtools` for debugging
 - Network
    - Render mock data, so layout is done and react has to done way less work when data is available.
    - To make a networks calls from javascript, JS engine needs to be up, It will delay making the network calls on the startup. Move network to native implementation.
 - Remove console.* statements.
