> **`async` is better**

## Without any async and defer

- Script tag without attributes will parse HTML till it hits the script tag
- then download the script, parse and execute it
- Resume parsing HTML

## **Async**

- Downloads the script in parallel to HTML parsing,
- When script is available, pause the parsing, execute the script
- Order of execution of scripts is not guaranteed, as script will execute as its available

## Defer

- Downloads the script in parallel to HTML parsing
- Execute scripts after the HTML parsing,
- Order of execution of scripts is guaranteed.

## Both async and defer

- Browsers which supports async, execute as async
- Old browsers executes as defer.
