Web Security has been a concern of every web developer. I think every one should pay little more attention to handle the security aspect of the web when they are developing the website/webapp.


In this post lets try to explain some of the key methods to enhance the security of the web sites we create.
These are some of the most popular ways to help increase the security of web.

## CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS is popular method to dis-allow scripts from other domain( domain, protocol or port) to run on your website.
If you still want to run scripts from other domain. You need to do some work on the server side.
That is why this policy is call cross origin resource sharing. If you want to share resources you need to explicitly enable it. 
By default browsers will not allow it and there will be an error if you try to access the resources from other domain which are not explicitly enabled.
 - If web page is requesting a resource on different protocol. You will get Mixed content error and request will fail.
 - If web page is request a resource from different domain it will get error like `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.` and request will fail.

### Access-Control-Allow-Origin

 To allow domain a web page to access the resources from other domains. Server should send 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' response headers back in the response.
 ```
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
 ```

  > \* means all the anyone can access this resource.

To limit the access, you need to pass the domain name in there
```
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://anujverma.netlify.com/
 ```

 ## Preflight request
 If the resource is being fetched from cross-domain. Browsers will make `OPTIONS` http request for the resource first to determine
 if it is safe to make the actual request. If the response of `OPTIONS` request is not `200 OK` with Access Control Headers, browsers will not issue actual request.
 This is to keep in mind whenever we implement CORS we need to handle all the `OPTIONS` requests as well.

 > It will be overkill to add another METHOD in your apis to support CORS. Its advisable to manage OPTIONS request response on web server like nginx or apache.


CORS has really allowed us to have fine grained control over the resource sharing.

### Access-Control-Request-Headers
Access-Control-Request-Headers is used by the browsers in the preflight request to tell server which all headers can be available in the actual request.
```
  Access-Control-Request-Headers: Accept,Authorization,Cache-Control
```

### Access-Control-Allow-Header
This will be the response header of the preflight request which send above mentioned `Access-Control-Request-Headers` to indicate which headers can be used when issuing request for actual resource.
```
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept,Authorization,Cache-Control
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
```


### Access-Control-Request-Method
Similar to Access-Control-Request-Headers, this header is used in preflight request to tell server in which METHOD actual request will be issued.
```
  Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
```

### Access-Control-Allow-Method
Similar to Access-Control-Allow-Headers, this header is used in response of preflight request to tell which all methods are allowed for the resource.
```
  Access-Control-Allow-Method: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
```

### Access-Control-Expose-Headers
This lets server to control which all headers are allowed for browsers to access from request.
```
  Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Authorization
```

### Access-Control-Max-Age
This lets server to tell browsers how long preflight response can be cached in browsers.
```
  Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```
 > Max age is defined in seconds.


### Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
This header is set in the response of the preflight request to make sure if the actual request can be made with credentials or not.
```
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```
If this header value is true, actual request can be made with using `withCredentials` in XHR or fetch Request. 

Now you can understand how powerful this CORS policy is and how much control is available for customization.
In the next blog we will understand how CORB(Cross Site Read Block) policy works.
